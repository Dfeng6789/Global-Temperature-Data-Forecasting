# Global-Temperature-Data-Forecasting
## Collaborators: Ethan Chee and Lori Sun

The goal of this project is to use a dataset of global temperature data from Kaggle that we cleaned alongside other related datasets to train various machine learning models to see if it can predict the test temperatures we feed it and also possibly future temperatures, in light of global temperatures trends caused by global warming and other environmental components.
